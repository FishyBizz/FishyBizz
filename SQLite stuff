----SIMPLE REVIEW OF BASIC SQL PROPERTIES----

SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type = table -> shows names of tables

SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE name = 'table_name' -> shows structure of stated table


SELECT * FROM -- LIMIT 3
-SELECT -> SELECT <colomn>, <column>, ...
-FROM -> FROM <table> 
-LIMIT -> # of rows to display
-(*) -> all columns

SELECT * FROM -- WHERE <clause>

FROM -- WHERE <clause> LIKE '%rn'
-(%) -> any # of characters
-(_) -> (_) # of characters

COUNT(<column>) -> returns # of non-NULL rows
-to check if a value is NULL, use IS & IS NOT

CASE 
  WHEN <clause> THEN <result>
  WHEN <clause> THEN <result>
  ELSE <result>
END
ex. 
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN county = 'Harris' THEN 1
      ELSE NULL END),
  COUNT(CASE WHEN county = 'Baxter' THEN 1
      ELSE NULL END)
FROM ----

ORDER BY block
-ASC 
-DESC
-ORDER BY -- DESC

there are MIN, MAX, and AVG aggregate functions
SELECT MIN(ex_age) FROM --

SELECT DISTINCT -

GROUP BY block
SELECT -- FROM -- GROUP BY county HAVING COUNT(*) > 2

JOIN block -> allows info from other table
<table> JOIN <table2> ON 
-there's LEFT JOIN & OUTER JOIN
-LEFT JOIN preserves all first tables rows even if none of table2 match
-OUTER JOIN preserves all rows of both tables even if none match
